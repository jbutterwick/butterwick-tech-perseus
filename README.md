This is really cool.

(Perseus)[https://github.com/framesurge/perseus] is to (Sycamore)[https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore] what Next.JS is to React.

But Perseus does a whole bunch of stuff that Next can't do. Such as SSR + SSG on the same page. It also has advanced framework features like Internationalization. Check out their (comparisons page)[https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/comparisons] for more information.
