[Perseus](https://github.com/framesurge/perseus) aims to be to [Sycamore](https://github.com/sycamore-rs/sycamore) what Next.JS is to React.

But Perseus does a couple of things that Next can't do. Such as SSR + SSG on the same page. It also has advanced framework features like Internationalization. Check out their [comparisons page](https://framesurge.sh/perseus/en-US/comparisons) for more information.
